Component:
            Component is a function whose first letter is capital.
            it is made so that our tag does not overwrite with html  tag call componet like calling html tag(eg div, p, ...)
            component is a custom tag.

            componet must have only one wrapper.


HTML Tag:

        You can treat hmtl tags ( div,p..) as a  data,
        it means you can return it or you can savve tag to variable.

---> so in general we are just defining new tags.

---> index.js is our main component

---> file mixed with ms and html is called jsx
---> react is enhanced in such a way js files are also recognized as jsx. So only the logo is changed.


--------------- JSX --------------------------


JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in 
React to describe the UI elements. It looks similar to HTML but
allows you to write HTML elements directly within JavaScript, 
making it easy to define the structure and appearance of the user interface.

-- components name should be capital

curly braces for performing operation inside any tags.


""

import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import Info1 from './Info1';

function App() {
 
  return (
    <div >
      <Info1></Info1>  # the component can be imported by placing the text start <Info1(in this part)></Info> and typing ctrl + space
    </div>
  );
}


export default App;

""
---> Booleans cannot be displayed in browser.

---> html tags are data which can be stored in variables in JS.


# if a coponenet is started with small letter than
 the import cannot be done, and also if we rename 
 the the file name to capital.

# then we can have to create a new file, the file with same name will pose the same problem.
